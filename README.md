## Overview
This project aims to expand the capabilities of the "tiny drone" simulation (Assignment 1). Our goal is to create a high-quality, open-source platform that supports the simulation of a control algorithm of a drone.</br>
Additionally, the drone will be capable of scanning an entire map efficiently, similar to a robotic mop cleaner.

## Features
*  Control Algorithm Simulation: Implement and test a higher quality and more efficient algorithm for map scanning.
*  Return to Start: Enable the drone to autonomously return to its starting point based on it's sensor measurements.

#### Nice to have
* 3D simulation
* Reinforcement Learning: Utilize the platform to experiment with and learn reinforcement learning methods

* This work is representing a concept of intelligent vision-less micro-drones, inspired by flying animals such as insects, birds, and bats. The presented micro-drone, named BAT (Blind Autonomous Tiny-drone), can perform bio-inspired complex tasks without the use of cameras. The BAT uses LIDARs and self-emitted optical flow to avoid obstacles and solve mazes. The controlling algorithms were implemented on an onboard microcontroller, allowing the BAT to be fully autonomous. Additionally, a method was developed to use the information collected by the drone to generate a detailed map of the environment. A complete model of the BAT was implemented and tested in various scenarios, both in simulation and field experiments, demonstrating its ability to explore and map complex buildings autonomously, even in total darkness.
